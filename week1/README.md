# Resources and Office Hours

- Office Hours
  - Quick questions, project help, code review
  - Web / Skype / Hangout: Schedule with us in advance
- Slack
- Posting Assignments
  - Due 12:00pm before class

# Class Methods
- The idea of the class is to immerse you in programming and learn a new language or method by the time we are done.
- We'll and code as as an additional tool to our design process, solving complex and specific problems in our projects.
- We'll show you what tools and systems are available. It's up to you to
choose what you need. We'll help you a long the way.
- If you already know programming, thats great! We'll continue to reinforce
these skills and learn new ones even faster. Try Swift!
- Design wise, we'll measure our successes by not only the code we write, but
the problems code enables us to solve.
- We'll learn how to evaluate what's good Copy Pasta v.s bad Copy Pasta. We want you to own your successes and failures.

# Real-time
- Lot's of feedback and communication.
- Coding is massive; we want to know what's confusing and what's not.

# Silicon

Grace Jones. What does she have to do with code? In the 80s there was an entire Bond film about the destruction all of Silicon Valley. Why Silicon?


![Jones](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areaofeffect/hello-world/master/week1/images/silicon/silicon_mayday.jpg?token=AADEj3GUVHAM_LqUioLQBQGiZ0lboj4Uks5ZuUqxwA%3D%3D)

  The element silicon is used extensively as a semiconductor in solid-state devices in the computer and microelectronics industries. For this, hyperpure silicon is needed. The silicon is selectively doped with tiny amounts of boron, gallium, phosphorus or arsenic to control its electrical properties.
  
Grace Jones saves the day. 

(note: the goals are money and power, but it's more in hindsight. it's about human evolution)

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. 

Silicon together with Moore's law is the driving force behind everything that's happened with computers since the microcontroller. 

It is an interesting time now because we are about to hit a physical wall where the 

> Moore's law has died at the age of 51 after an extended illness.

# Kernel
Many times when evaluating a toolchain, you end up with Linux. And why is that?

Linux now supports more different types of devices and processors than any other operating system ever has in the history of computing. It runs on everything from mobile phones, to laptops and cloud servers, to raspberry pi.

![Kernel Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areaofeffect/hello-world/master/week1/images/kernel/1280px-Kernel_Layout.svg_.png?token=AADEj1jaj1k1T3e4s7G3l5OxQuiPXdUeks5ZuUr6wA%3D%3D)

This is largely due to the development of it's kernel.

*Beautiful Code, Chapter 16*

1. Small objects loosely coupled
2. Iterative dev process
3. Extremely collaborative

# Algorithms

![Sol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areaofeffect/hello-world/master/week1/images/algorithms/tiedie.png?token=AADEj9_Ke9ABTA5qyzx2WnmF09oGrmrfks5ZuUyFwA%3D%3D)

The thing about algorithms is that they are really, really beautiful.

And, they solve really hard problems in computer science. Which makes computational tasks run better, which makes things more beautiful, which makes our lives better.

If you are interested, try exploring the many ways to sort something. 'Can we do better?' - a question that computer scientists ask themselves.

Or just explore their jaw-dropping beauty.

# Software Tools
We'll start by downloading our favorite tools to grow our workflow and process.

Goals:
- To become familiar with programming tools and consoles.
- Execute intro JS and Python
- Learn process and workflow
- Detect errors
