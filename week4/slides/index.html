# Loops

_a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached._

You can use loops to run sections of code over and over again.
There are many types of loops but we will focus on `for` and `while` for learning.

# for loops - Python

- try it out: [repl link](https://repl.it/LaMW)

```python
for x in range(1,10):
  print(x)
```

```javascript

# for loops - C example

- there's a repl: [for that too!](https://repl.it/L709/0)

# why use loops?
- draw loops
- repetition / paterns
- [Form + Code](http://formandcode.com/code-examples/repeat-embedded)
- draw() and loop()
- looping through an array

---
class: inverse, left
# for loop, array

Python example
```python
fruits = [ "mango", "banana", "apple" ]
for fruit in fruits:
  print fruit
```

---
class: inverse, left
# for loop, array

- try it out: [repl link](https://repl.it/L70V/0)
- [https://www.learn-js.org/en/Loops](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Loops)

JavaScript example
```javascript
// declare an array
var fruits = [ "mango", "strawberry", "kiwi" ];

// loop through items in arary
// note: .length is a property of array datatype that results to 3
for (x = 0; x < fruits.length; x++) {
  console.log(fruits[x]); // print each string
}
```
---
class: inverse, left
# for loop, array

C example

```c
char * fruits [] = { "mango", "banana", "apple"" };
int len = sizeof(fruits)/sizeof(fruits[0]);
int i;
for(i = 0; i < len; ++i)
{
  Serial.println(fruits[i])
}
```

# while loops

Python example

  increaseCount() # call a function we defined above
```

# while loops

JavaScript example

- [repl link](https://repl.it/L72P/1)
- [w3schools: while example](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_while)

```
while (i < 10) {

    i++;
}

# while loops

C example

- try in a repl: [repl link](https://repl.it/L73B/0)
- [arduino example](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/WhileStatementConditional)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

   /* local variable definition */
   int a = 0;

   /* while loop execution */
   while( a <= 10 ) {
      printf("value of a: %d\n", a);
      a++;
   }

   return 0;
}

# "break" and "continue" statements

Below is a python example that will break and exit the loop once the count is greator than five.

- try it out: [repl link](https://repl.it/LaMW)

```python
for x in range(1,10): # a for loop that counts from 1 to 10
  if (x > 5):     # a conditional, are we less than 5
    break       # exit the loop once our count is higher than 5
  else:
    print(x)
```

# draw()

A draw loop is a type of loop that occurs *every frame* of your application. It is generally used for programing animations, interactions or visuals. Think of it working like a movie or gif with sequential frames.

In Arduino programming this is simply called loop().

>After creating a setup() function, which initializes and sets the initial values, the loop() function does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond. Use it to actively control the Arduino board.

# recursion

The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

- Factorials
- Fractals
- Inception
